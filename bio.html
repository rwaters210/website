   On an early Thursday morning in the rocket city, Huntsville, AL; my big head bursted into the world and began the flow of life.I've aspired to exist in comparison to the natural state of my last name that I love to embrace, <em><strong>Waters</strong></em>. Just go with the flow like H20. Riding the wave of life, I've matricualted through the primary and secondary school system attending schools differing in predominantly racial makeups. Though, like water I adpated to those distinct enviroments and it has made a well rounded person capable of being in various situations. I have amazing parents whose advice has guided me on riding the wave to success and a younger brother who is also my best friend. I'm blessed to have a family pictured below that supports me all throughout my life.

  I decided to attend Tennessee State University because I wanted to be valued as African American striving to achieve my ancestors dream. Despite the freezing weather and absence of student during my tour on school break, I envisonioned the liveliness and potential the University was known for. In addition, my tour guide provided me with valuable knowlegde that drove my decision to go there. It is an HBCU which means Historically Black College & University. The HBCU experience is one of kind filled with constant trips to financial aid, the famous fried chicken wednesdays, homecoming week, and alot more disticnt things that make a HBCU. Along with that, I've also learned alot that has refined me into the person I am as I continue to ride the wave of life aiming for success.
