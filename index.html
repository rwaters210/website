      <p> Wassup!!! It's your boy Russ H20 out here making websites. I'm practicing my technical skills that I can use for the future. This is just the beginning, big things coming soon!!! I'm a rising sophmore who attends the elustrious <strong>Tennessee State University</strong>. This summer I was blessed with the opportunity to work for <Strong><em>LGE & KU</em></Strong> as an IT Intern where I can gain valauable professional experience in the workplace and be actively engaged learning new things on the job.</p>

    <p> I love to interact with people of all origins and share fun times with them. I'm a retired track athlete but still find myself exercising for my desire of being healthy and fit. I enjoy watching movies and going on longs walks immersed in nature. I'm very friendly and love to laugh. Humor is a big part of my personality because it's better to spend time laughing at something rather than being mad, upset, or etc. <br /> The future holds endless opportunties that I'm preparing myself early to take advanatge over. As my Dad says <q> Once you start working, you'll never stop until you retire.</q> Which is true because ever since I started my first job at subway 16 years old, I've continued working and currently I'm interning with <em> LGE & KU </em> which has been amazing. </p>

    This website displays my aspirations to become an innovative programmer who enjoys taking on the challenges of developing web applications. It is and will always be a work in progress because as I continue gain more knowledge it will improve.
