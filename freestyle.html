   This is the freestyle page and its designed for you to read this text quickly before it disappears like this.....Now if your speed reader, try to finish reading this sentence while it goes through one cycle. You made it this far!!! Maybe through 1 or 2 cycles of it going up. Though try to prove me wrong because I believe its impossible to go from the beginning of this text to HERE in one cycle. Ready. Set. Go!!!

         Hope you had fun with the challenge above because this one seems a little slower so I guess your just going have to be patient to see what happens next!!!............................................................................................................................................................................. and were back to give the word of the day "Supercalifragilisticexpialodocious" Thank you for your time

          Now isn't this alot better,despite the fact that your reading this veeeeeeerrrrrrrrryyyyyyy slooooooooowwww, you can read everything in one cycle and it will continue on until the end of this text. Not right there but when you see the word repeat in bold at the end. So without further ado, have fun on the next piece of text. Bye ;)   <strong>Repeat!!!</strong>

         Congratulations!!! You made it to ths piece of text that is moving at a similar speed to the first text you read. Yet, it's moving down and you notice how much reading is left and half of it may look like gibberish, so your trying to decipher it right now and that it is disappearing as you read and probably stop reading by now because you don't got time for this and I just used a polysyndeton and that's to many "ands" for one sentence so sorry for that :( ................ But for you amazing people still reading this I want show how smart your brains are by reading this It deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.
