Combining all the drops of information and appying it to my life has allowed me to ride the wave to a succesful future. I believe that method of listening and implementing advice has created a bright future for me. For example, I got an summer internship after my first year in college. That isn't the case for most freshman in college. I was constantly reminded of it throughout the school year because it seemmed unusual to others for a freshman to aim that high. Though, utlizing the advice from my counselors and believeing in myself granted me the exclsuive opportunity to work at the biggest utlity company in Kentucky, LGE & KU. This is just the first big step as I progress through my professional career learning and living on this wave of life. <br><br>

  Personally, I plan to develop myself as leader by observing the qualities of those I respect as a role model and leader in my life. They directed me to the path of success and believe in me to achieve. I’ve learned that the simple of act of encouraging to someone to move forward on the right path can positively impact their future. There is nothing better than helping someone to become great in life. So,having these influential figures in my life has developed my value to be a leader and positively impact others the way I’ve been impacted. I aim to collaborate with others to start riding their wave of future success as I have embarked on.
